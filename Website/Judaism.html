	<h1>Judaism</h1>
	
	<p>• Judaism and first people who practiced it had a huge impact on western civilization.<br>
	
• Abram was told by God to move west and he would be famous. When Abram arrived at Canaan, he was given the name "Abraham" (the father of many). His descendants became Hebrews.<br>

• Hebrews were ancestors of Jews and moved into the desert grasslands around the Fertile Crescent around 2000 and 1500 BC and are known because of writings about Judaism and their early history. These writings also founded the Christian and Hebrew bibles.<br>

	• Hebrews' early history is found in five books, one of which is the Torah, the most sacred text of Judaism and with other books is part of the Hebrew Bible, the Old Testament in the Christian Bible.<br>
	
	• The Torah traces Judaism back to Abraham who made a covenant with God: If Abraham abandoned his home and polytheism, he would be led to a Promised Land and the descendants mighty.<br>
	
	• The land was called Canaan along the eastern Mediterranean Sea. His grandson Jacob (Israel) had 12 sons which were ancestors of the Twelve Tribes of Israel and Hebrews became the Children of Israel or Israelites. Israelites consider Abraham, Isaac (son), and Jacob (grandson) patriarchs (ancestral "fathers")<br>
	
	• Some left Canaan to Egypt due to famine and the pharaoh feared an uprising so he enslaved them<br>
	
	• (From the Torah)Moses was an Israelite born under the pharaoh and was told by God to lead the Israelites out of Egypt.<br>
	
	• The pharaoh refused to give them freedom, so God rained plagues on the Egyptians and the Exodus was a journey leading the Israelites out of Egypt, and they thought that God was watching over them.<br>
	
	• Major event in Jewish culture and celebrate Passover, eating special meals symbolizing hardships in Egypt.<br>
	
	• The Israelites wondered the deserts for years when they came to the mountain Sinai where God have Moses two stone tablets with the Ten Commandments<br>
	
	• The Ten Commandments states that there is only one god and stresses the importance of life, self-control, and justice. They made a covenant with God to follow these rules and they had an influence on Western Civilization.<br>
	
	• The Israelites wandered for 40 years before coming to Canaan which they believed was their gift from God, but others lived there now. They fought until they won Canaan and it became Israel.<br>
	
• Small, scattered communities were held together by The Twelve Tribes and each community chose judges to enforce laws and settle disputes. This was the time of prophets which were messengers from God to keep Israelites focused on their faith.<br>

	• Philistines attacked and the effort to drive them out united the Israelites under one king.<br>
	
	• Saul, chosen for military leadership. Troubled and jealous and never well-loved.<br>
	
	• David, very loved. Good military leader, musician, and poet. Grew Israel into Jerusalem.<br>
	
	• Solomon (David's son) made Israel reach the height of its wealth and through trade became very rich and built a large temple in Jerusalem.<br>
	
	• Year after Solomon the fight over king pushed 10 tribes north to make Israel and 2 south made the Kingdom of Judah and were the Jews.<br>
	
	• After a few centuries Israel fell to Assyrians and scattered the people of Israel in the empire. Judah fell to Chaldeans which enslaved them in Babylon and destroyed Solomon's temple, the Babylonian Captivity. This started the Diaspora (scattering of Jews out of Judah)<br>
	
	• Persia took over the Chaldeans and let the Jews return, only some did where they rebuilt Solomon's temple (The Second Temple).<br>
	
• Religion was the Jewish foundation for their society and Judaism's central belief continues to do so<br>

	• Monotheism, belief in one God, Jews were the believed first. Ancient world believed in many gods.<br>
	
	• Emphasis on righteousness led to creation of code of ethics. Expected to never cheat, lie, discriminate. Ethic tradition carried into Christianity (Judeo-Christian Ethics).<br>
	
	• Mosaic law governs praying and eating and ethics. Food prepared for these laws are kosher (fit).<br>
	
• Important writings include the Torah, Prophets (teachings of early prophets), and Writings (everything, lessons, history, songs, proverbs). And Talmud contains explanations of other sacred texts over centuries of writing. Belief in sacred texts united the Jewish.<br>
