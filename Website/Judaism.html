		The Shield of David, a hexagram, was used in multiple cultures and civilizations, and was only associated with Judaism through 3 events. <br><br>
		It began with followers of Shabbetai Tsevi bearing an amulet. The amulet was a hexagram with the letters MBD, Mashiah ben David or &quot;Messiah, son of David&quot;<br><br>
		The symbol came to be associated with Judaism in the late 1700s, but was not accepted by Orthodox Jews.<br><br>
		The next two events cemented the symbol with Judaism. The first event was the Zionist movement&lsquo;s adoption of the symbol, where it appeared on the flag of Israel. In the 1930s to 1940s, Jews were forced to wear a yellow Shield of David with the word &quot;Jude&quot;, or Jew, in all Nazi controlled lands.<br><br>
		The symbol stayed with Judaism throughout their hardship, and so was accepted into most Jewish places of worship and has become a positive symbol of Judaism.<br><br>
